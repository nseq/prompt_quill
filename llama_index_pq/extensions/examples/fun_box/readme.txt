# extensions/examples/fun_box/README.txt

Welcome to the Fun Box Example Extension!

This is a sample extension to show developers how to:
- Add a new tab ("Fun Box" with sub-tabs)
- Inject into an existing tab ("Chat" with a "Make it Silly!" button)
- Extend another extension ("Chat Enhancer" with a "Twist the Sentiment!" button)

To see it in action:
1. Move this "fun_box" folder up one level to "extensions/fun_box/".
2. Restart Prompt Quill.
3. Check the "Chat" tab for new buttons and look for a "Fun Box" tab!

Happy coding!
